import os

#1St Concept ---->

# print(os.getcwd())#----->Current working Directory
# os.chdir("C://")
# print(os.getcwd())#----->Directory Changed to (C://)    

#2nd Concept---->

# print(os.listdir("C://"))#--->This willl make a list of items that are present in a particiular area

# os.mkdir("Tester")#This will make a folder in a particular path with there name

# os.makedirs("This/that")#----->This will make a folder this in which that folder also exist
# #makedirs are also used to make sub directories
            # os.rename("karan.txt","Karanshx.txt")#----->This will rename the file which exist...

# print(os.environ.get('path'))#----->It will get the path which is running currently.
# print(os.path.join("C://","/karanshx.txt"))#It will remove all the extra slashes that are involved in the path you entered

# print(os.path.exists("C://Program Files"))#This will return True if the path entered has already exist..
# print(os.path.exists("C://Karan"))#This will return False if the path entered does not exist..

# print(os.path.isfile("C://Program Files"))#It will return false if the type of the thing is directory or any thing inspite of File.
